Game:

obstacles, the player can rotate the tunnel to change the bottom side or jump. The obstacles
should initially be stationary and in later levels moving
Score is given according to distance travelled. The player will level up when certain scores
are attained and that will cause increasing the difficulty of the game by speeding it up. The
primary objective is to score as much as possible.
